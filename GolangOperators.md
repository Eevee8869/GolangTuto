### Arithmetic Operators
###### + | adds two operands 
###### - | subtracts two operands
###### * | multiplies two operands 
###### / | Divides the numerator by the denominator.
###### % | Modulus operator; gives the remainder after an integer division.
###### ++ | Increment operator. It increases the integer value by one.
###### -- | Decrement operator. It decreases the integer value by one.

### Relational Operators
###### == | It checks if the values of two operands are equal or not; if yes, the condition becomes true.
###### != | It checks if the values of two operands are equal or not; if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.
###### > | It checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand; if yes, the condition becomes true.
###### < | It checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of the right operand; if yes, the condition becomes true.
###### <= | It checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand; if yes, the condition becomes true
###### >= | It checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand; if yes, the condition becomes true.

## Logical Operators
##### && | Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true.
##### || | Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true.
#####  ! | Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.
