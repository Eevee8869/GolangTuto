### Arithmetic Operators
###### + | adds two operands 
###### - | subtracts two operands
###### * | multiplies two operands 
###### / | Divides the numerator by the denominator.
###### % | Modulus operator; gives the remainder after an integer division.
###### ++ | Increment operator. It increases the integer value by one.
###### -- | Decrement operator. It decreases the integer value by one.

### Relational Operators
###### == | It checks if the values of two operands are equal or not; if yes, the condition becomes true.
###### != | It checks if the values of two operands are equal or not; if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true.
###### > | It checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand; if yes, the condition becomes true.
###### < | It checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of the right operand; if yes, the condition becomes true.
###### <= | It checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand; if yes, the condition becomes true
###### >= | It checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand; if yes, the condition becomes true.

## Logical Operators
##### && | Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non-zero, then condition becomes true.
##### || | Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands is non-zero, then condition becomes true.
#####  ! | Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true then Logical NOT operator will make false.

## Assignment Operators
#####= | Simple assignment operator, Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand
##### += | Add AND assignment operator, It adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand
##### -= | Subtract AND assignment operator, It subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand
##### *= | Multiply AND assignment operator, It multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand
##### /= | Divide AND assignment operator, It divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand
##### %= | Modulus AND assignment operator, It takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand
##### <<= | Left shift AND assignment operator
##### &= | Bitwise AND assignment operator
##### ^= | bitwise exclusive OR and assignment operator
##### |= | bitwise inclusive OR and assignment operator
